Well, I have this DAO to handle my products in my catalog. It uses sqlite to 
store my products. A product is nothing more than an id, an EAN and a name.
To avoid store products duplicated I check the EAN to be unique in my db.

I found that something is not working well in my code, and I
decided to fix it by the method of TDD. Unfortunately I am a very busy guy, so
I do not have the time to fix. I would like to ask you to patch it! All I have
is a ToDo list for you ;)

You may now me I am choosy so here are some rules:
- You CAN change the fingerprint of the methods!
- You MUST NOT change the names of the public methods!
- You MUST NOT change my database schema!
- You MUST NOT touch my production database from your tests!
- You MUST keep the functionality described in code documentation.
- You SHOULD NOT extend functionality, so there is no need to add extra validation etc.

TODOs:
- Refactor the class to be able to test the public methods!
- Write the tests using separate sqlite database!
- Find the bug in the class (with your tests) and fix it!

Would be nice to have:
- Check the class characteristic and introduce an exception if it would be a better practice!
- Check if the class have code duplication, and refactor it!

Oh, I almost forgot, my db schema is:

CREATE TABLE product (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    ean varchar(64) default '',
    name text default ''
);
